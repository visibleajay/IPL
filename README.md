# IPL

Through this application, we are generating the lost excitement and interest of cricket in many vipul's.

This project is generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Major Libraries/Frameworks

1) Angular-cli:- For creating a fundamental Angular2 project structure.
2) Angular:- Optimized, Fast and Improved version of Angular1.
3) Plotly:- For plotting basic charts like Bar, Pie.

## Bonus Points
1) I am using Angular as a framework instead of using vue.js
2) I have used ChangeDetectionStrategy for updating VisualPlotComponent. VisualPlotComponent content will only re-render when the input to the component is going to be changed.
3) For making this app mobile responsive, I have used @media for applying the margin on the parent component.
4) 
5) We are using pre-downloadable libraries instead of any CDN link.
